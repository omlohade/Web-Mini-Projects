# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game supports two modes:

1. **2 Players**: Play against a friend.
2. **Play vs AI**: Challenge an AI opponent.

The game is deployed on two platforms for easy access:

- **Vercel**: A static deployment of the game.
- **Google Cloud (App Engine)**: A Flask-based deployment of the game.
